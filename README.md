This project was part an order from a Fiverr client and part me wanting to expand my knowledge into Machine Learning. Developed using Java and the Processing Library, there are three modes for a user to choose from. The first being simple two player chess where two players on the same device can play against each other. The next allows the player to run a genetic algorithm and see the chess neural network learn. I used a genetic algorithm to pit two networks against each other and the best one will be used as the basis for the next model. The final option allows the player to play against the trained neural network.
